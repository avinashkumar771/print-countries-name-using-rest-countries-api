                    copy  by value                                                           copy by refrence

 1.mainly used on primitive data types.                                        Mainly used on composite datatypes.
2. used only to copy the value of the variable not the address.              used to copy not only the values but address too.

3.var a=10;                                                                    var arr= [1,2,3]
 var b=5;								    var arr2 = arr1
									arr[0] = 10;	                                     								
 var c= a;                                                           in above code , arr will change as [10,2,3] because both arr and arr2 point to the same address.
var d =b;
  
  in above code, if we change the value of c it'll not affect the value of a.
