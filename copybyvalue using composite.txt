How do we copy by value in a composite data type?

One of the ways of copying the composite data type by value is achieved with the help of spread operator (…).

CopyByValue using SpreadOperator for Composite data type
var arr =[1,2,3,4];
var arr2 =[...arr];
arr[0] = 5;
console.log(arr);
console.log(arr2);
//output
[5,2,3,4]
[1,2,3,4]


In the above image, the array2 has the elements of array1 copied into it. Any changes made to array1 will not be reflected in array2 and vice versa.
Hence with the help of Spread operator(…) ,we can copy by value for composite data types.
